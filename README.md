MEMORIZE! A fun and fluid game for matching cards.

Memorize is a game project from a CS193P Stanford's University course for iOS App Development using SwiftUI üòç.

Its bases are from the lessons videos, but the course have a list of assignments that give students the opportunity to study, discover and apply all the benefits of SwiftUI. It's visually beautiful, and for the moment we have learned about things like:

-Swift and SwiftUI basics
-Creating reusable components (cards) with structs, and combining them to make more complex UI interfaces.
-MVVM
-Swift Types system
-Property Observers
-Computed properties and variables
-Protocols and Extensions
-Animations! in the shuffling, dealing, and flipping of cards.
